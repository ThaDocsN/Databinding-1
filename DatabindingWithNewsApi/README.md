# Databinding with News Api
This is a simplified News App. It has only two fragments: one fragment contains list of recent articles and the second fragment shows details of the chosen article. It uses NewsApi for fetching articles. It uses some Android Jetpack components like ViewModel and LiveData. It checkes internet connection and fetches data if there is connection. It shows a loading indicator during api call, it shows the list when data arrives and it shows an error message if there is no network.
As for data binding, it demonstrates use custom binding adapters and helper methods. It also demonstrates use of LiveData inside binding expressions.
